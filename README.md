# Ubi-prediction-SVM-project1

This project is application of machine learning in computational biology.

The server website is: http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/araubisite/index.php



My responsibilities include:

– Used SVM and Random Forest to bulid well-performed machine-learning based predictors for Protein Ubiquitination sites through feature selection, optimization and cross-validation

– Evaluated model performance with ROC analysis with highest AUC value of 0.869

– Related Skills: Java, Python, R, PHP, mySQL, Linux, SVM, Random Forest

– Built Front-End web server: AraUbiSite for researchers to use

– First-authored academic paper published in 2019: http://www.eurekaselect.com/170610/article
